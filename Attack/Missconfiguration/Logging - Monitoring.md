Logs should include:

-   HTTP status codes
-   Time Stamps
-   Usernames
-   APIÂ endpoints/page locations
-   IP addresses

Monitoring hints for an Attack:

-   multiple unauthorised attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorised resources e.g. admin pages)
-   requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.
-   use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate an attacker is using automated tooling.
-   common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use Cross Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorised/malicious testing on applications.
