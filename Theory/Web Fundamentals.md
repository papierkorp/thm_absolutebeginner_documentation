# HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure

same as [HTTP](#HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol) just with Data encrypted


# File Filtering

- Client Side Filtering
  - per Browser
  - can easily be avoided
- Server Side Filtering
  - more difficult to evade
  - nearly impossible to completly evade -> use payloads to avoid present filter

- Extension Validation
  - easy to change
  - blacklist/whitelist
- File Type Filtering
  - MIME Validation (Windows)
    - Format: `<type>/<subtype> = Content-Type: image/jpeg`
  - Magic Number Validation (Linux)
    - Magic Numer of File = String of Bytes at the beginning of the File Content
    - e.g. PNG = `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1 A 0A`
    - [List of Signatures in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)
- File Length Filtering
- Filte Name Filtering
  - checking if there is a file with a similiar name
  - filtering for special chars
- File Content Filtering
  - is complex
